      "question": "What is Selector? ",
      "answer": "\nThe way you declare which elements the styles should apply to. There are different kinds of selectors:\n\n* ```Class```: The most commonly used selector. E.g. “.cloudy” to select an element with classname cloudy. There can be more than 1 element with the same classname.\n\n* ```ID```: Use this sparingly. You cannot reuse an ID within the same page and used only to identify an element uniquely. E.g. ```<div id=lovelyweather></div>```\n\n* ```Attribute Selector```: If you use any attribute other than class or id to identify an element in a stylesheet, you would be using Attribute Selectors. You can also do basic pattern matching within an attribute selector (so if you would like to do basic pattern matching for selectors using class or ID attributes, you would want to use attribute selectors).\n\n* ```Pseudo-Classes```: Classes that are applied to elements based on information that is not present in the markup, e.g. :first-child or :last-child. Do note that the selectors are parsed from right to left (see the demo). You cannot use section ```article:first-child``` to select the first occurrence of article, if the first child of section is h1 and not article. Likewise with the :nth-child, and :last-child pseudo-classes.\n\n* ```Pseudo-Elements```: Pseudo-elements differ from Pseudo-Classes in that they actually create an element in the document tree. This is almost the first instance of CSS modifying the HTML document tree. You should ideally use pseudo-elements with “::” instead of “:” (but most browsers accept “:” notation for CSS 2.1 pseudo-elements). Pseudo-elements are: ```::first-line```, ```::first-letter```, ```::before```, ```::after``` (See the demo for how pseudo-elements work).\n        \n\n- - - -\n"

      "question": "What is CSS BEM",
      "answer": "\n\nThe BEM methodology is a naming convention for CSS classes in order to keep CSS more maintainable by defining namespaces to solve scoping issues. BEM stands for Block Element Modifier which is an explanation for its structure. A Block is a standalone component that is reusable across projects and acts as a “namespace” for sub components (Elements). Modifiers are used as flags when a Block or Element is in a certain state or is different in structure or style.\n\n```css\n/* block component */\n.block {\n}\n\n/* element */\n.block__element {\n}\n\n/* modifier */\n.block__element--modifier {\n}\n\n```\n\nHere is an example with the class names on markup:\n\n```css\n<nav class=\"navbar\">\n  <a href=\"/\" class=\"navbar__link navbar__link--active\"></a>\n  <a href=\"/\" class=\"navbar__link\"></a>\n  <a href=\"/\" class=\"navbar__link\"></a>\n</nav>\n\n```\n\nIn this case, ```navbar``` is the Block, ```navbar__link``` is an Element that makes no sense outside of the navbar component, and ```navbar__link—active``` is a Modifier that indicates a different state for the ```navbar__link``` Element.\n\nSince Modifiers are verbose, many opt to use ```is-*``` flags instead as modifiers.\n\n```css\n<a href=\"/\" class=\"navbar__link is-active\"></a>\n```\n\nThese must be chained to the Element and never alone however, or there will be scope issues.\n\n```css\n.navbar__link.is-active {\n}\n\n```\n\n###### References\n\t\t* https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/\n- - - -\n"

      "question": "Explain CSS sprites, and how you would implement them on a page or site. How do you go about creating them? What are possible alternatives to sprites?    ",
      "answer": "\n    \nCSS sprites combine multiple images into one single larger image. It is a commonly-used technique for icons. How to implement it:\n\n* Use a sprite generator that packs multiple images into one and generate the appropriate CSS for it.\n* Each image would have a corresponding CSS class with `background-image`, `background-position` and `background-size` properties defined.\n* To use that image, add the corresponding class to your element.\n\n**Advantages:**\n\n* Reduce the number of ```HTTP``` requests for multiple images (only one single request is required per spritesheet). But with ```HTTP2```, loading multiple images is no longer much of an issue.\n* Advance downloading of assets that won’t be downloaded until needed, such as images that only appear upon `:hover` pseudo-states. Blinking wouldn’t be seen.\n\n\n* When you have multiple images/ icons, browser makes separate call to the server for each one of them. sprite is a technique to combine all/ some of them (usually similar one in terms of type of image. For example, you will put jpg in one sprite) in one image. To display the icon you set height, width and background position.\n\n**Alternatives:**\n\n* Data URIs - allow you to embed the image data directly into a stylesheet. This avoids additional HTTP requests for images, making it essentially the same thing as a sprite, without the fancy positioning.\n\n* Icon Fonts\n\n* SVGs\n\n\n###### References\n\n* https://css-tricks.com/css-sprites/\n\n* https://css-tricks.com/spriting-img/\n\n* http://css-tricks.com/data-uris/\n\n\n- - - -\n"

      "question": "What are the benefits of CSS sprites?",
      "answer": "\nIf a web page has large no. of images that takes a longer time to load because each image separately sends out an ```HTTP``` request. The concept of CSS sprites is used to reduce the loading time for a web page because it combines the various small images into one image. It reduces the number of ```HTTP``` requests and hence the loading time. \n    \nCSS sprites combine multiple images into one image, limiting the number of HTTP requests a browser has to make, thus improving load times. Even under the new HTTP/2 protocol, this remains true.\n\nUnder HTTP/1.1, at most one request is allowed per TCP connection. With HTTP/1.1, modern browsers open multiple parallel connections (between 2 to 8) but it is limited. With HTTP/2, all requests between the browser and the server are multiplexed on a single TCP connection. This means the cost of opening and closing multiple connections is mitigated, resulting in a better usage of the TCP connection and limits the impact of latency between the client and server. It could then become possible to load tens of images in parallel on the same TCP connection.\n\nHowever, according to benchmark results, although HTTP/2 offers 50% improvement over HTTP/1.1, in most cases the sprite set is still faster to load than individual images.\n\nTo utilize a spritesheet in CSS, one would use certain properties, such as ```background-image```, ```background-position``` and ```background-size``` to ultimately alter the background of an element.\n\n\n\n- - - -\n"

      "answer": "\n* The CSS float property is used to move the image to the right or left along with the texts to be wrapped around it. It doesn’t change the property of the elements used before it\n\n* float pushes an element to the sides of a page with text wrapped around it. you can create entire page or a smaller area by using float. if size of a floated element changes, text around it will re-flow to accommodate the changes. You can have float left, right, none or inherit.\n\n* if you set, ‘float: left;’ for an image, it will move to the left until the margin, padding or border of another block-level element is reached.

Setting position: relative; on an element and no other positioning attributes, it will no effect on it's positioning. It allows the use of ```z-index``` on the element and it limits the scope of absolutely positioned child elements. Any child element will be absolutely positioned within that block.\n\n```fixed```, element is positioned relative to viewport or the browser window itself. viewport doesn't changed if u scroll and hence fixed element will stay right in the same position.\n\n* ```static``` default for every single page element. The only reason you would ever set an element to position: static is to forcefully-remove some positioning that got applied to an element outside of your control.\n\n\n* ```sticky``` - Sticky positioning is a hybrid of relative and fixed positioning. The element is treated as `relative` positioned until it crosses a specified threshold, at which point it is treated as `fixed` positioned.\n\n###### References\n\n    * https://css-tricks.com/absolute-relative-fixed-positioining-how-do-they-differ/\n\n---\n"

      "answer": "\n\n\nit depends on what you are trying to do.\n\n* ```px``` gives fine grained control and maintains alignment because 1 px or multiple of 1 px is guaranteed to look sharp. px is not cascade, this means if parent font-size is 20px and child 16px. child would be 16px.\n\n* ```em``` maintains relative size. you can have responsive fonts. em is the width of the letter 'm' in the selected typeface. However, this concept is tricky. 1em is equal to the current font-size of the element or the browser default. if u sent font-size to 16px then 1em = 16px. The common practice is to set default body font-size to 62.5% (equal to 10px). em is cascade\n\n* ```%``` sets font-size relative to the font size of the body. Hence, you have to set font-size of the body to a reasonable size. this is easy to use and does cascade. for example, if parent font-size is 20px and child font-size is 50%. child would be 10px.\n\n* ```pt```(points) are traditionally used in print. 1pt = 1/72 inch and it is fixed-size unit.\n\n\n---\n"

Re-compilation time can be slow.\n\n* Advantages of SASS/LESS: Use of variables, mixins, nesting, looping, partials and more.\n\n* Advantages POSTCSS: Use of future syntax. Ability to select only the plugins you need for a particular project. Writing plain CSS and applying the plugin to output necessary syntax that suits your needs – which in turn allows for the ability to remove or update that plugin if at any time it is not useful anymore. In other words, POSTCSS offers a lot of flexibility AND all of the features SASS/LESS offer. Versions of POSTCSS have been developed for both Grunt and Gulp.\n\n* Disadvantage POSTCSS: Keeping track of plugins for older projects could get hairy, though you have a package.json to reference.\n\n* Disdvantages of SASS/LESS: They are monolithic, and you need to learn a new language.\n\n- - - -\n"

Floated elements remain a part of the flow of the page, and will affect the positioning of other elements (e.g. text will flow around floated elements), unlike `position: absolute` elements, which are removed from the flow of the page.\n\nThe CSS `clear` property can be used to be positioned below `left`/`right`/`both` floated elements.\n\nIf a parent element contains nothing but floated elements, its height will be collapsed to nothing. It can be fixed by clearing the float after the floated elements in the container but before the close of the container.\n\nThe `.clearfix` hack uses a clever CSS [pseudo selector](#describe-pseudo-elements-and-discuss-what-they-are-used-for) (`:after`) to clear floats. Rather than setting the overflow on the parent, you apply an additional class `clearfix` to it. Then apply this CSS:\n\n```css\n.clearfix:after {\n  content: ' ';\n  visibility: hidden;\n  display: block;\n  height: 0;\n  clear: both;\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively, give `overflow: auto` or `overflow: hidden` property to the parent element which will establish a new block formatting context inside the children and it will expand to contain its children.\n\n###### References\n\n* https://css-tricks.com/all-about-floats/\n\n- - - -\n"

Browsers match selectors from rightmost (key selector) to left. Browsers filter out elements in the DOM according to the key selector and traverse up its parent elements to determine matches. The shorter the length of the selector chain, the faster the browser can determine if that element matches the selector.\n\nFor example with this selector `p span`, browsers firstly find all the `<span>` elements and traverse up its parent all the way up to the root to find the `<p>` element.

Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional layout, so things can be arranged in an unbroken line. Grid is designed for two-dimensional layout, meaning the items don't need to sit next to each other. In the future we're likely to use both: Grid Layout for main page areas, and flexbox for the smaller UI elements it excels with.\n\n\n- - - -\n"

      "question": "How is responsive design different from adaptive design? What is responsive design? What is the difference between fixed and fluid layouts? What are some of the pros and cons with these designs?",
      "answer": "\n\nBoth responsive and adaptive design attempt to optimize the user experience across different devices, adjusting for different viewport sizes, resolutions, usage contexts, control mechanisms, and so on.\n\nResponsive design works on the principle of flexibility - a single fluid website that can look good on any device. Responsive websites use media queries, flexible grids, and responsive images to create a user experience that flexes and changes based on a multitude of factors. Like a single ball growing or shrinking to fit through several different hoops.\n\nAdaptive design is more like the modern definition of progressive enhancement. Instead of one flexible design, adaptive design detects the device and other features and then provides the appropriate feature and layout based on a predefined set of viewport sizes and other characteristics. The site detects the type of device used and delivers the pre-set layout for that device. Instead of a single ball going through several different-sized hoops, you'd have several different balls to use depending on the hoop size.\n\n###### References\n\n* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Archive/Apps/Design/UI_layout_basics/Responsive_design_versus_adaptive_design\n* http://mediumwell.com/responsive-adaptive-mobile/\n* https://css-tricks.com/the-difference-between-responsive-and-adaptive-design/\n\n- - - -\n"

      "question": "Have you ever worked with retina graphics? If so, when and what techniques did you use? What kind of techniques do you use to handle images for retina screens?",
      "answer": "\n\n_Retina_ is just a marketing term to refer to high resolution screens with a pixel ratio bigger than 1. The key thing to know is that using a pixel ratio means these displays are emulating a lower resolution screen in order to show elements with the same size. Nowadays we consider all mobile devices _retina_ defacto displays.\n\nBrowsers by default render DOM elements according to the device resolution, except for images.\n\nIn order to have crisp, good-looking graphics that make the best of retina displays we need to use high resolution images whenever possible. However using always the highest resolution images will have an impact on performance as more bytes will need to be sent over the wire.\n\nTo overcome this problem, we can use responsive images, as specified in HTML5. It requires making available different resolution files of the same image to the browser and let it decide which image is best, using the html attribute `srcset` and optionally `sizes`, for instance:\n\n```html\n<div responsive-background-image>  \n  <img src=\"/images/test-1600.jpg\"\n    sizes=\"\n      (min-width: 768px) 50vw,\n      (min-width: 1024px) 66vw,\n      100vw\"\n    srcset=\"\n      /images/test-400.jpg 400w,\n      /images/test-800.jpg 800w,\n      /images/test-1200.jpg 1200w\">\n</div>\n```\n\nIt is important to note that browsers which don't support HTML5's `srcset` (i.e. IE11) will ignore it and use `src` instead. If we really need to support IE11 and we want to provide this feature for performance reasons, we can use a JavaScript polyfill, e.g. Picturefill (link in the references).\n\nFor icons, I would also opt to use SVGs and icon fonts where possible, as they render very crisply regardless of resolution.\n\n###### References\n\n* https://css-tricks.com/responsive-images-youre-just-changing-resolutions-use-srcset/\n* http://scottjehl.github.io/picturefill/\n* https://aclaes.com/responsive-background-images-with-srcset-and-sizes/\n\n- - - -\n"

      "question": "Is there any reason you'd want to use translate() instead of absolute positioning, or vice-versa? And why?",
      "answer": "\n\n\n`translate()` is a value of CSS `transform`. Changing `transform` or `opacity` does not trigger browser reflow or repaint but does trigger compositions; whereas changing the absolute positioning triggers `reflow`. `transform` causes the browser to create a GPU layer for the element but changing absolute positioning properties uses the CPU. Hence `translate()` is more efficient and will result in shorter paint times for smoother animations.\n\nWhen using `translate()`, the element still occupies its original space (sort of like `position: relative`), unlike in changing the absolute positioning.\n\n###### References\n\n* https://www.paulirish.com/2012/why-moving-elements-with-translate-is-better-than-posabs-topleft/\n\n\n- - - -\n"

      "answer": "\n\nNote that these two 2 approaches are not exclusive.\n\nMaking a website responsive means the some elements will respond by adapting its size or other functionality according to the device’s screen size, typically the viewport width, through CSS media queries, for example, making the font size smaller on smaller devices.\n\n```css\n@media (min-width: 601px) {\n  .my-class {\n    font-size: 24px;\n  }\n}\n@media (max-width: 600px) {\n  .my-class {\n    font-size: 12px;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nA mobile-first strategy is also responsive, however it agrees we should default and define all the styles for mobile devices, and only add specific responsive rules to other devices later. Following the previous example:\n\n```css\n.my-class {\n  font-size: 12px;\n}\n\n@media (min-width: 600px) {\n  .my-class {\n    font-size: 24px;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nA mobile-first strategy has 2 main advantages:\n\n* It’s more performant on mobile devices, since all the rules applied for them don’t have to be validated against any media queries.\n* It forces to write cleaner code in respect to responsive CSS rules.\n\n——\n\n### How is responsive design different from adaptive design?\n\nBoth responsive and adaptive design attempt to optimize the user experience across different devices, adjusting for different viewport sizes, resolutions, usage contexts, control mechanisms, and so on.\n\nResponsive design works on the principle of flexibility - a single fluid website that can look good on any device.

      "answer": "\n    \nFirstly, understand that browsers match selectors from rightmost (key selector) to left. Browsers filter out elements in the DOM according to the key selector and traverse up its parent elements to determine matches. The shorter the length of the selector chain, the faster the browser can determine if that element matches the selector. Hence avoid key selectors that are tag and universal selectors. They match a large number of elements and browsers will have to do more work in determining if the parents do match.\n\n[BEM (Block Element Modifier)](https://bem.info/) methodology recommends that everything has a single class, and, where you need hierarchy, that gets baked into the name of the class as well, this naturally makes the selector efficient and easy to override.\n\nBe aware of which CSS properties trigger reflow, repaint, and compositing. Avoid writing styles that change the layout (trigger reflow) where possible.\n\n###### References\n\n* https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rendering/\n* https://csstriggers.com/    \n\n- - - -\n\n### Sass\n\n- - - -\n"

Nesting provides a visual hierarchy as in the HTML and increases the readability.\n\n* mixins: mixins are used to include a bunch of properties or group declarations together. It allows for the easy reuse of blocks of code. Use include to\n\n* Inheritance: extends are useful for sharing a generic definition with selectors rather than copying it in.\n\n* If/Else Statements and loops\n\n* import: separating your codes in small pieces is helpful for expressing your declarations and increasing maintainability and control over the codebase.\n\n* Math operations: can be used for standard arithmetic or unit conversions.\n\n\n- - - -\n"

The server can then use this information to return a version of the document in the appropriate language if such an alternative is available. The returned HTML document should also declare the `lang` attribute in the `<html>` tag, such as `<html lang=\"en\">...</html>`.\n\n* In the back end, the HTML markup will contain `i18n` placeholders and content for the specific language stored in YML or JSON formats.

Anything more than a handful of replacements like this can quickly get out of control.\n    \n* Restrictive words/sentence ```length``` Some content can be longer when written in another language. Be wary of layout or overflow issues in the design. It's best to avoid designing where the amount of text would make or break a design. Character counts come into play with things like headlines, labels, and buttons. They are less of an issue with free-flowing text such as body text or comments.\n    \n* Be mindful of how colors are ```perceived``` Colors are perceived differently across languages and cultures. The design should use color appropriately.\n    \n* Formatting dates and ```currencies``` Calendar dates are sometimes presented in different ways. Eg. \"May 31, 2012\" in the U.S. vs. \"31 May 2012\" in parts of Europe.\n\n* Do not concatenate translated ```strings``` Do not do anything like `\"The date today is \" + date`. It will break in languages with different word order. Use a template string with parameters substitution for each language instead. For example, look at the following two sentences in English and Chinese respectively: `I will travel on {% date %}` and `{% date %} 我会出发`. Note that the position of the variable is different due to grammar rules of the language.\n\n* Language reading ```direction``` In English, we read from left-to-right, top-to-bottom, in traditional Japanese, text is read up-to-down, right-to-left.\n\n---\n"

      "question": "Why is it generally a good idea to position CSS <link>s between <head></head> and JS <script>s just before </body>? Do you know any exceptions?",
      "answer": "\n**Placing `<link>`s in the `<head>`**\n\nPutting `<link>`s in the head is part of proper specification in building an optimized website. When a page first loads, HTML and CSS are being parsed simultaneously; HTML creates the DOM (Document Object Model) and CSS creates the CSSOM (CSS Object Model). Both are needed to create the visuals in a website, allowing for a quick \"first meaningful paint\" timing. This progressive rendering is a category optimization sites are measured in their performance scores. Putting stylesheets near the bottom of the document is what prohibits progressive rendering in many browsers. Some browsers block rendering to avoid having to repaint elements of the page if their styles change. The user is then stuck viewing a blank white page. Other times there can be flashes of unstyled content (FOUC), which can shows a webpage with no styling applied. \n\n**Placing `<script>`s just before `</body>`**\n\n`<script>`s block HTML parsing while they are being downloaded and executed. Placing the scripts at the bottom will allow the HTML to be parsed and displayed to the user first.\n\nAn exception for positioning of `<script>`s at the bottom is when your script contains `document.write()`, but these days it's not a good practice to use `document.write()`. Also, placing `<script>`s at the bottom means that the browser cannot start downloading the scripts until the entire document is parsed. This ensures your code that needs to manipulate DOM elements will not throw and error and halt the entire script. If you need to put `<script>` in the `<head>`, use the `defer` attribute, which will achieve the same effect of downloading and running the script only after the HTML is parsed.\n\n###### References\n\n* https://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html#css_top\n* https://www.techrepublic.com/blog/web-designer/how-to-prevent-flash-of-unstyled-content-on-your-websites/\n* https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path/    \n\n---\n"

      "answer": "\n\nIt is rendering the data as it’s being downloaded. This is particularly useful on documents that have tons of text. You can see it on a page that has a lot of text – and where the scrollbar will get shorter in length as more data comes in – increasing the vertical size of the document – yet, it would display the downloaded text immediately. As more data came down the pipe – the page would get longer. This didn’t rely on the closing body or html tag – and it certainly wouldn’t render the entire page on the server – then download – which is a standard complaint about modern frameworks. But there is a technique called “Flushing the Buffer” that can be implemented on the server. I don’t know that much about the technique, but found a few resources discussing it.\n\n---\n"

That means for SSR your browser will start rendering the HTML from your server without having to wait for all the JavaScript to be downloaded and executed.\n    \n* for SSR, the user can start viewing the page while all of that is happening. For the CSR world, you need to wait for all of the above to happen and then have the virtual dom moved to the browser dom for the page to be viewable.\n\n\n---\n"

So if you have a JavaScript web application that enhances a persons ability to send information to a database with features like ajax – at the very least you need to provide the ability for a person to send that same information without JavaScript enabled. In this case a simple form with full-page refresh will do what you need.\n\n- - - -\n"

Images can be some of the heaviest files we deliver, so compress wisely. Soon the picture element will be implemented across browsers, so we can optimize the delivery of image content. Also in the near future consider using WebP format for images – it is quite smaller in size than JPEG and PNG files. Finally, use a CDN or other domains to host your resources and leverage domain sharding.\n\n- - - -\n"

      "question": "What is the purpose of cache busting and how can you achieve it?",
      "answer": "\n\nBrowsers have a cache to temporarily store files on websites so they don't need to be re-downloaded again when switching between pages or reloading the same page. The server is set up to send headers that tell the browser to store the file for a given amount of time. This greatly increases website speed and preserves bandwidth.\n\nHowever, it can cause problems when the website has been changed by developers because the user's cache still references old files. This can either leave them with old functionality or break a website if the cached CSS and JavaScript files are referencing elements that no longer exist, have moved or have been renamed.\n\nCache busting is the process of forcing the browser to download the new files. This is done by naming the file something different to the old file.\n\nA common technique to force the browser to re-download the file is to append a query string to the end of the file.\n\n```css\n    src=\"js/script.js\" => src=\"js/script.js?v=2\"\n```\n\nThe browser considers it a different file but prevents the need to change the file name.    \n\n\n- - - -\n"

      "question": " Ways to improve website performance",
      "answer": "\n\n* Minimize HTTP Requests\n\t\t* Sites are mainly slow because of too many (or too large) HTTP requests. We can eliminate unnecessary request;\n\t\t\t\t* combined files: js to a file, css to a file\n\t\t\t\t* CSS sprites: CSS Sprites are the preferred method for reducing the number of image requests. Combine your background images into a single image and use the CSS background-image and background-position properties to display the desired image segment.\n\n* Use a Content Delivery Network CDN\n\n\t\t* A CDN is essentially many optimized servers around the world that deliver web content to users based on their geographic location. This means big performance improvements for site users. Because, say, if a person accessing your site in India, they will be retrieving web content from a server nearby\n\n* Optimize Images:\n\n\t\t* image sizes make a huge difference to site speed. The larger content/images, the slower the site. we could:\n\t\t\t\t* Changing the resolution: reducing the “quality” of the image (and thereby the file size)\n\t\t\t\t* Compressing the picture: increasing the efficiency of image data storage\n\t\t\t\t* Cropping the picture: when cropping, you are cutting out unneeded areas and thus making the image smaller in size\n\n* Put Scripts at the Bottom:\n\n\t\t* Javascript files can load after the rest of your page. The simplest solution is to place your external Javascript files at the bottom of your page, just before the close of your body tag. Now more of your site can load before your scripts. Another method that allows even more control is to use the defer or async attributes when placing external .js files on your site.\n        \n\t\t\t\t* Async tags load the scripts while the rest of the page loads, but this means scripts can be loaded out of order. Basically, lighter files load first. This might be fine for some scripts, but can be disastrous for others.\n        \n\t\t\t\t* The defer attribute loads your scripts after your content has finished loading. It also runs the scripts in order. Just make sure your scripts run so late without breaking your site.\n\n* Add an Expires or a Cache-Control Header\n\n\t\t* Web page designs are getting richer and richer, which means more scripts, stylesheets, images, and Flash in the page. A first-time visitor to your page may have to make several HTTP requests, but by using the Expires header you make those components cacheable. This avoids unnecessary HTTP requests on subsequent page views. Expires headers are most often used with images, but they should be used on all components including scripts, stylesheets, and Flash components.\n\n* Gzip Components\n\n\t\t* Compression reduces response times by reducing the size of the HTTP response. Gzipping generally reduces the response size by about 70%.\n\n* Put Stylesheets at the Top:\n\n\t\t* This is because putting stylesheets in the HEAD allows the page to render progressively.\n\n* Avoid CSS Expressions\n\n* Use GET for AJAX Requests:\n\n\t\t* Ajax is that it provides instantaneous feedback to the user because it requests information asynchronously from the backend web server\n\n* Make JavaScript and CSS External:\n\n\t\t*  Using external files in the real world generally produces faster pages because the JavaScript and CSS files are cached by the browser. JavaScript and CSS that are inlined in HTML documents get downloaded every time the HTML document is requested. This reduces the number of HTTP requests that are needed, but increases the size of the HTML document. On the other hand, if the JavaScript and CSS are in external files cached by the browser, the size of the HTML document is reduced without increasing the number of HTTP requests.\n\n* Use get to ajax request:\n\n\t\t*  POST is implemented in the browsers as a two-step process: sending the headers first, then sending data. So it's best to use GET, which only takes one TCP packet to send (unless you have a lot of cookies).\n\n* No 404s:\n\n\t\t* HTTP requests are expensive so making an HTTP request and getting a useless response (i.e. 404 Not Found) is totally unnecessary and will slow down the user experience without any benefit.\n\n* Reduce Cookie Size:\n\n\t\t* HTTP cookies are used for a variety of reasons such as authentication and personalization. Information about cookies is exchanged in the HTTP headers between web servers and browsers. It's important to keep the size of cookies as low as possible to minimize the impact on the user's response time.\n\n* Reduce DNS Lookups\n\n* Minify JavaScript and CSS\n\n* Avoid Redirects\n\n* Remove Duplicate Scripts\n\n* Configure Etags\n\n* Make Ajax Cacheable\n\n* Post-load Components\n\n* Preload Components\n\n* Reduce the Number of DOM Elements\n\n* Minimize the Number of iframes\n\n* Minimize DOM Access\n\n* Optimize CSS Sprites\n\n* Don't Scale Images in HTML\n\n* Make favicon.ico Small and Cacheable\n\n* Avoid Empty Image src\n\n- - - -\n"

In a browser, this API is available to JavaScript where DOM nodes can be manipulated to change their styles, contents, placement in the document, or interacted with through event listeners.\n\n\n* The DOM was designed to be independent of any particular programming language, making the structural representation of the document available from a single, consistent API.\n\n* The DOM is constructed progressively in the browser as a page loads, which is why scripts are often placed at the bottom of a page, in the <head> with a defer attribute, or inside a DOMContentLoaded event listener. Scripts that manipulate DOM nodes should be run after the DOM has been constructed to avoid errors.\n\n* document.getElementById() and document.querySelector() are common functions for selecting DOM nodes.\n\n* Setting the innerHTML property to a new value runs the string through the HTML parser, offering an easy way to append dynamic HTML content to a node.\n\n\n- - - -\n"
